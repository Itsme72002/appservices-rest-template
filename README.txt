Welcome to the Apigee App Services template app for use through the RESTful API!

App Services is Apigee’s hosted version of the open-source technology “Usergrid” — you may find references to that name in a few places. 

You will need to make a few edits for this template to work. Open curl_example.sh in a text editor (Notepad, TextMate, SublimeText, or your preferred IDE) and follow the instructions inside.

If you followed the steps correctly, you should see a visual confirmation when you execute ./curl_example.sh in your terminal!
(N.B.: you may need to “chmod u+x curl_example.sh” to be able to run the example.)

This sample is maintained by Tim Anglade. Please open all bugs as issues on our github repo, or email tim@apigee.com if you have any questions.
